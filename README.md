## üíª Usage

The DRE CLI tool (version 0.5.9) provides various commands for managing IC infrastructure:

```bash
# View all available commands
dre --help

# Common commands:
dre network        # Network-wide management operations, such as healing all subnets
dre subnet         # Subnet management, such as replacing nodes in a subnet
dre governance     # Commands and actions related to the IC NNS governance, such as submitting NNS motion proposals
dre proposals      # Listing or analyzing submitted NNS proposals
dre nodes          # Node operations, such as removing nodes from the IC
dre registry       # Registry reading
dre get            # Wrapper around ic-admin get-* commands
dre propose        # Wrapper around ic-admin propose-* commands
dre firewall       # Submitting proposals for firewall updates
dre node-metrics   # Getting the trustworthy node metrics
dre update-authorized-subnets  # Automatically updating the list of public IC subnets, based on subnet utilization
dre neuron         # Neuron topping up and checking balance
```

### Authentication Options

- `--private-key-pem`: Path to private key file (PEM format)
- `--neuron-id`: Explicitly setting the Neuron ID for governance operations, overriding the autodetection
- `--network`: Target network (mainnet, staging, or testnet)
- `--ic-admin`: Custom path to ic-admin
- `--hsm-*`: Hardware Security Module configurations

### Additional Options

- `--verbose`: Print detailed information
- `--dry-run`: Simulate operations without execution
- `--offline`: Run operations offline when possible
- `-y, --yes`: Skip confirmation prompts
