# How to make a new release

Go to the repo root, and check that you don't have any dirty changes and that you are on the main branch.

```
git checkout main
git pull
git status
```

If all looks okay, you can run the following convenience script to change the versions in the repo code, and checkout out the new branch and push it to github.

Example:

```

Next, go to the github repo and open the PR, get it approved and merge it.

Next, create and push the git tag to the repo, to trigger the release CI workflow.

```
git checkout main
git pull
git status
./bin/mk-release.py --tag 0.5.0
```

Wait for the triggered [GH action to finish](https://github.com/dfinity/dre/actions). It will take some time because it's building binaries for x86 and for darwin.

Now open the [GH releases page](https://github.com/dfinity/dre/releases).
You should see a new draft release. Edit it, to shorten the release notes by removing entries for older (previous) releases.

Set the `latest` to point to this new release, and finally click publish.

Celebrate!
