## Background

As part of an ongoing effort to to incentivise neurons to verify proposals in depth,¬†voting grants will be provided for candidates selected by the community. Overall, 2 candidates are selected for each of 4 proposal topics.¬†**This is one of multiple motion proposals submitted today to select these candidates**:

- one NNS motion proposal is submitted for each candidate and topic for which the candidate applied¬†
- for each proposal, the result is computed as the number of YES minus the number of no votes (#YES-#NO)
- for each topic, the 2 candidates with the highest results get the grants

You can read more about the motivation and the process¬†[here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/grants-for-voting-neurons/32721).

## Proposal Topic

IC OS Version Election, Protocol Canister Management

## Is this a team grant application?

yes

Hi @lara and Everyone,

I am Manvick, founder of Zenith Code LLC, and my team are excited to apply for the ‚ÄúIC OS Version Election‚Äù grant. We have been actively involved in the IC community since mid 2022. We have in-depth knowledge of creating dapps on ICP including but not limited to writing smart contracts in Motoko and architecting/designing multi canister apps on ICP. We are also a node provider on the ICP network.

Application Details

Topic(s) we Apply For:

1. IC OS Version Election
2. Protocol Canister Management

Team Grant: Yes

Size of our Team: 6 members

### Relevant Experience and Technical Knowledge

- Operating nodes for several months on ICP (Zenith Code LLC).
- Relevant experience in installing IC OS and monitoring nodes.
- Strong understanding of the ICP infrastructure layer.
- As a development shop in the ecosystem, we have assisted various projects in setting up their proof of concept and MVP.
- Actively contributed to writing dapps in Motoko for in-house purposes.
- Over 7 years of experience in web3 and large-scale distributed systems.
- ICP enthusiast with a deep understanding of its core technology and architecture.
- Experience in designing large-scale distributed systems for storing user data across multiple nodes in RF-2 and RF-3 production clusters.
- Worked on the design and development of NDFS (Nutanix Distributed File Storage), similar to Google File System and blockchain data storage.

### Why we Want to Be a Voting Neuron

- By becoming a voting neuron we want to contribute towards decentralization of the ICP network.
- We believe we have the right skill set to evaluate the proposals and vote on them.
- We want to become a leading voting neuron with the capability of reviewing other governance proposals in the future.

### Why We Need the Grant

We have been working full-time jobs and working part time on IC, and the grant will help us get one step closer to contributing full-time to the IC community. With Zenith Code, We plan to expand, add more nodes, develop large-scale distributed DAO products, and add significant value to the IC community.

### Long-Term Interest in ICP

We are fascinated by ICP technology and its long-term goals of creating a community cloud infrastructure. This vision, if realized, will add immense value globally and reduce dependence on major cloud players like AWS and GCP in the market. Zenith Code is also a stakeholder and long term node provider in the IC ecosystem.

### Interest in the Topics Applied For

We are interested in applying for

1. IC OS Version Election.
2. Protocol Canister Management.

We have expertise in large scale distributed systems, particularly distributed software-defined storage, cryptography, and web3.

### Long-Term Commitment as a Voting Neuron

As an existing node provider in the IC ecosystem, we are committed to the long-term growth of the IC network. This commitment is driven by both personal interests and a broader vision of making the world a better place by contributing in the development of public cloud infrastructure.

### Voting Principles

Core Principle: Decentralization

- Definition and Relevance: The Nakamoto Coefficient measures the number of entities that must collude to control a system. A higher coefficient signifies greater decentralization and, consequently, a more secure and resilient network.
- Application to Voting: Applying this principle to voting within the IC ecosystem, we emphasize the need for a diverse and decentralized set of voters to prevent centralization and ensure fair representation of the community‚Äôs interests.

Ensuring Robust Decentralization

- Diverse Voting Participation: By adhering to decentralization principles, our voting approach aligns with the IC community and foundation. This means advocating for broad participation across various stakeholders to avoid power concentration.

Evolving with Community Decisions

- Adaptive Voting Strategy: Our commitment to evolving voting strategies based on community discussions reflects a dynamic approach to maintaining and enhancing decentralization. We plan to formalize a process in which we will actively listen to community inputs and adapt our voting accordingly.
- Continuous Improvement: By aligning future voting with community conclusions on decentralization, our approach ensures that the network remains resilient to centralization risks, analogous to maintaining a high Nakamoto Coefficient.

We are eager to contribute to the ICP community in a structured and impactful way. Thank you for considering our application. üôè
