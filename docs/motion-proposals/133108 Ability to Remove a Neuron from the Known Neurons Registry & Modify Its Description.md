This proposal recommends two key improvements to the known neurons management in the Network Nervous System (NNS):

1. **Enable the modification of a known neuron’s description** without requiring a name change. This would allow neuron owners to keep their descriptions current as their expertise, voting topics, or goals evolve over time.

2. **Allow for the complete removal of a known neuron from the registry** through an NNS proposal. This would provide flexibility for users who no longer wish to maintain their neuron in the known registry, offering greater control over their privacy and participation.

### Detailed Rationale

Recent efforts to implement the changes outlined in proposal [130832](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130832) soon will made it possible for all neurons - particularly known neurons - to provide greater transparency regarding their voting behavior and governance decisions. As part of this process, users are given the choice of how much information they wish to disclose regarding their neurons’ stake and votes. However, many neurons were added to the known neuron registry before these transparency measures were introduced, and there is now a need to address two key issues:

1. **Inability to update neuron description without a name change**: Currently, once a neuron is registered as a known neuron, its description cannot be modified without also changing the name. This presents a challenge for those who may shift their focus or expertise over time and wish to communicate these changes to their followers. Updating neuron descriptions should be a straightforward process that doesn't necessitate a name change, which is currently the only workaround (e.g., modifying the capitalization of the name).

2. **Inability to remove a neuron from the known neuron registry**: There are legitimate reasons why a user may wish to withdraw their neuron from the known neuron registry, whether due to privacy concerns or changes in how the neuron is used. Presently, this functionality does not exist. The implementation of proposal 130832 introduces new transparency rules that may cause privacy concerns for those neurons that were added to the registry before these changes. Enabling a removal mechanism via an NNS proposal would provide the flexibility needed to address this issue.

### Benefits

1. Enhances the user experience by making it easier to update neuron descriptions and manage their public profile.

2. Protects user privacy by providing a way to remove known neurons from the registry, if desired.

3. Increases flexibility for neuron controllers to adapt their known neurons as their focus, expertise, or goals evolve.
