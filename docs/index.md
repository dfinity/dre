# Decentralized Reliability Engineering (DRE)

Welcome to the documentation for DFINITY's Decentralized Reliability Engineering (DRE) tools and processes. This documentation covers everything you need to know about managing, monitoring, and maintaining the Internet Computer network.

## What is DRE?

DRE (Decentralized Reliability Engineering) is a comprehensive suite of tools and practices designed to manage the Internet Computer network in a decentralized manner. Our tools help maintain network reliability, manage updates, and ensure the smooth operation of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

## Key Components

### DRE CLI Tool
A command-line interface tool that provides essential functionality for:
- Managing subnet configurations
- Handling node operations
- Executing network updates
- Monitoring system health

### Internal DRE Dashboard
A web-based interface offering:
- Real-time network monitoring
- Deployment management
- System metrics visualization
- Operational status tracking

### Service Discovery
Maintains an up-to-date registry of:
- IC network targets
- Log aggregation endpoints
- Metrics collection points

### Log Management
Comprehensive logging solutions for:
- Host nodes
- Guest nodes
- Boundary nodes
- Canister operations
