# IC-Admin proposal Node Provider Remuneration:

This proposal describes the updated remuneration that is applicable to new Node Providers that implement nodes based on the Generation 2 Hardware specification. The remuneration is summarized on this wiki page: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration, and has been shared with the community in this forum thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/128.

The remuneration model accounts for the fact that the second generation of node hardware is significantly more expensive than the first generation. It reduces the profit margin to 90%, i.e. a multiplier of 1.9, as the risk for node providers is lower since the IC is an established blockchain network. The operational expenses are increased to allow for a 10% inflation per year.

All prices are in XDR unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The remuneration will be further updated and refined for new geographies, such as South America, Africa, and Australia as well. This is work in progress, and updates will be posting as a new proposal to be voted upon by the community.
