# Node Provider Remuneration for Type 1 nodes

This proposal describes the updated remuneration that is applicable to Gen1 Node Providers who have paid to have upgraded storage in their nodes. The remuneration is summarized on this wiki page: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration, and has been shared with the community in this forum thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-of-gen1-np-remuneration/10553/7

The remuneration model accounts for the original CAPEX and OPEX and the additional expenses involved with the upgraded storage.
