# Release process

1. Register new release / version

```yaml
releases:
  - rc_name: rc--2024-02-21_23-01
    versions:
      - name: baseline
        version: 2e921c9adfc71f3edc96a9eb5d85fc742e7d8a9f
```

2. Once the Google Doc is finished, PR will be created with release notes. Once it's merged, the proposal will be placed and forum post updated.
