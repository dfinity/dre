* [`16fabfd24`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/16fabfd24) Networking: revert: reqwest https outcalls

A regression was observed in a [commit](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/357ec1abcc81fcea5de9d30d54c7e6ffa40a3488) that switched the http client library used to perform HTTPS outcalls in this week's RC. The regression affects HTTPS outcalls to IPv4 targets which might experience more frequent timeouts compared to before the change. Accessing such targets via HTTPS outcalls is only allowed on system subnets. Subnet `uzr34` was upgraded to this version and the Exchange Rate Canister (XRC) was affected as requests to IPv4 targets experience sporadic timeouts. The Exchange Rate Canister is still able to retrieve enough data to keep the exchange rates up to date but in order to be cautious we propose to revert the offending commit and deploy a version without it on `uzr34` with an expedited schedule. The same version will be deployed on `w4rem`. The remaining subnets will be upgraded to the RC version proposed and adopted earlier this week by the community as they should not be affected by this change.
