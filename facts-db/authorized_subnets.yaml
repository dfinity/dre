name: Index of IC Mainnet subnets and their users
description: This file is used for keeping track of wether a given subnet is public or not, alongside the optional description as to why is the subnet in some state and has labels that will be used for filtering. The automation will automatically exclude all system subnets, state size over 300GB and with over 50k canisters. On top of that, there are labels which, if present in a subnet will result in that subnet being turned to a non-public subnet. Labels are case insensitive meaning that 'SNS' and 'sns' are the same label.

skipped_labels: ["sns", "european", "fiduciary"]
